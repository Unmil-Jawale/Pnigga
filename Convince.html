            <p>Nigga,<br>

Im very fucking sorry for what I did and I know I fucking shouldnt have. I‚Äôve been reflecting a lot on 
the time we spent on fucking chat and on my birthday and I genuinely regret handling stuff in such a dog shit manner. Pls understand, At that 
time I thought that it was the right thing to do for reasons that were unavoidable. But abhi realize hora hai
how much you meant to me and how fucking stupid I was for cutting off all contact.

I never intended to hurt you, but I know that I was immature and my actions did infact hurt you. For that, I am truly sorry. You have always been someone I 
fucking valued deeply, and life without you has definietly fucking not been the same. I miss the connection and every fucking
thing we had for each other. (this is not for your attention but its for you)

I know that I can‚Äôt take back the stupid past, but I hope we can create a new beginning (pls Im rlly in tht stupid 4 letter word 
that starts with L). If you understand, I would fucking love to be a part of each others lives again. I don‚Äôt expect anything
but I‚Äôm willing to put in all the effort to rebuild what I ruined.

Please take your time to think about this. Whether you choose to let me back into your life or not (please I fucking hope you do
), I want you to know that I will
always appreciate the moments we shared, and I am genuinely sorry for how I handled things.

Im very fucking sorry and I swear on everything and everyone dear to me and I promise this will never ever fucking happen again. Jabse tu gai hai everythings been fucking
different, Im not even fucking kidding anymore. Please dont be mad at me and appreciate this weird website I created üôè.
(you know I wouldnt take effort just for anyone in my life)

And haan ik I was a bit immature but Rand nhi hu, it took me a long time but I realized my mistake,
ive never talked about anyone else romantically but you and this isnt even a fucking joke. I changed myself a lot since the time you 
entered my life, I stopped flirting with people, I know I didnt commit and maybe thts why you thought of me as untrustable 
but I was scared due to many reasons. <br>

1) I was scared we wouldnt meet therefore I thought you or me would just get bored of it and our conversations would dry out
<br>
2) I thought of our own career paths and I thought it wouldve been better for us to focus on them rather than developing
    feelings for each other
<br>
3) I thought my feelings couldve changed randomly and then later if we broke up, I wouldve just hurt you again and I thought that itd 
    just be an unnesecary mark of me having an ex in the future.
    Im so fucking sorry for all of this, and im willing to change it. 

Im willing to commit and spend time keeping in touch because ik now that I will never find someone like you . Commiting to a 
relationship would be hard to work out since we would barely fucking ever meet. But I fucking hope you get my emotions I really 
cant afford fucking losing you again cause I Literally can fucking not develop feelings for anyone else.. im fucking cooked.

You know I havent taken effort for any fucking one in my life, pls I hope this helps you understand how important you are for me..
    

Thank you for reading this. I hope we can talk soon.
